"""
This is a Flask application that provides a basic blog functionality.

The application allows users to make posts that are stored in a MongoDB database. Each post consists of some content and
a date, which is automatically set to the current date when the post is made.

The application is served at the root URL ("/"). If a GET request is made to this URL, the application responds with
a page showing all the blog posts in the database. If a POST request is made, the application treats the body of the
request as a new blog post, stores it in the database, and then shows the updated list of blog posts.

Functions:
---------
create_app(): Creates and returns a Flask app with the above-described behavior.

Environment Variables:
---------------------
MONGODB_URI : A MongoDB connection string that specifies the database where the blog posts are stored.

    """
    Creates and returns a Flask application that interacts with a MongoDB database to provide basic blog functionality.

    The app provides a form at the root URL ("/") for users to submit new blog posts. Each blog post consists of some
    content, submitted via the form, and a date, which is automatically set to the current date when the post is made.

    If a GET request is made to the root URL, the application responds with a page showing all the blog posts in the
